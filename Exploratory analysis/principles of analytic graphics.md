## principles of analytic graphics

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
1. Comparison
```
evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis. so whenever you hear a statement or evidence based on data, always ask " compared to what? "

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
